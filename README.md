The Travel_ML.xlsx dataset contains customer profiles, including demographics, product pitches, travel history, and income.
It tracks whether customers purchased a travel product and factors like occupation, city tier, number of trips, follow-ups, and pitch satisfaction. 
This data can be used for predictive modeling, customer segmentation, and marketing strategy optimization

 ## Travel Product Data Analysis

## Overview  
This project focuses on customer profiling and the prediction of travel product purchases using the **Travel_ML.xlsx** dataset. The goal is to analyze customer behavior, demographics, and marketing strategies to optimize product sales and improve follow-ups.

## Files in the Project  
- **Travel_ML.xlsx**: Contains customer data, including demographics, travel history, and purchase behavior.  
- **Travel.ipynb**: (Uploaded notebook) Likely contains code for analyzing the dataset, building predictive models, or generating visualizations.

## Dataset Overview  
The **Travel_ML.xlsx** dataset includes the following key variables:  
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for customers  
- **ProdTaken**: Whether the travel product was purchased (1 = Yes, 0 = No)  
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Occupation, CityTier  
- **Travel Details**: Number of trips, preferred property rating, number of people visiting  
- **Marketing Metrics**: Duration of pitch, follow-ups, pitch satisfaction score  
- **Additional Data**: Monthly income, car ownership, passport status

## Steps 
1. **Data Inspection**:  
   - Loaded the dataset from `Travel_ML.xlsx` and reviewed its content.
   - Identified important columns for predictive modeling and customer segmentation.
  
2. **Initial Analysis Plan**:  
   - Possible use cases identified, including **predictive modeling**, **customer segmentation**, and **marketing strategy optimization**.

## Next Steps  
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, or inconsistent entries.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data.  
- **Model Building**: Use techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, or clustering to predict product purchase behavior.  
- **Evaluation**: Measure model performance and refine strategies based on results.  
- **Visualization**: Create meaningful charts to summarize customer trends.

## How to Run  
1. Open **Travel.ipynb** in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Ensure that the **Travel_ML.xlsx** file is accessible in the same directory or upload it to Colab.
3. Run the cells step-by-step to perform data analysis and modeling.
